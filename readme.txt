# Uncover

Uncover is a work-in-progress web game developed by Brayden Buchner. It's a game where you a guess a book's title by it's cover. 

## Planned Features

### Initial goals:
- Dynamic UI Re-Colouring: The colour scheme will dynamically adjust based on the dominant colours of the current book cover. 
- Responsive Layout: The website will be responsive and built with accessibility in mind, aiming to provide ease of and compatibility with devices of all sizes, and screen readers. 

### Next steps:
- Computer Vision: The letters of a book's title and author will be obscured using computer vision allowing correct-letter-guesses to reveal individual letters. 
- Automated Web-Scraping: Lists of award winning books could be automatically downloaded with their titles and images to a database to provide a puzzle-of-the-day indefinitely.
